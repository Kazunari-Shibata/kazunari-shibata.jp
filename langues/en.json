Additionally, by linking sales data with the external official online shop \"Gashapon<span>&reg;</span> Online\" in almost real-time, streamlined the process for users to make immediate purchases once they find the products they want. As a result, the site was able to drive approximately 13% of the total sales of the online shop."

To raise awareness about crime prevention, a competition for tray mats was held by the Nakamura Police Station of Aichi Prefecture and Japan McDonald's, which is active in community contributions. I won the grand prize in this competition. The tray mats were used in all McDonald's locations across the Tokai region, significantly contributing to the eradication of the JK Business, and I received a letter of appreciation from the Aichi Prefectural Police."
